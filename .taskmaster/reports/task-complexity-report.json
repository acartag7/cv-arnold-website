      "taskTitle": "Setup Project Infrastructure and Base Configuration",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 8,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the project setup into distinct configuration steps: Next.js 15 initialization with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4 setup with custom configuration, dependency installation (Framer Motion, Lucide React), project structure creation, linting/formatting setup (ESLint, Prettier), Git repository initialization, GitHub Actions workflow configuration, and environment variables setup. Each subtask should include specific configuration details and verification steps.",
      "reasoning": "This foundational task involves multiple complex configurations including Next.js 15 (latest version), Tailwind CSS v4 (major version with breaking changes), TypeScript strict mode setup, and CI/CD pipeline. Each component requires careful configuration to ensure compatibility and optimal developer experience."

      "taskTitle": "Design System and Component Library Implementation",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 10,
      "expansionPrompt": "Create subtasks for: theme system architecture with 3+ themes, theme provider and context implementation, base component creation (Button, Typography, Layout, Card, Badge), responsive grid system (8px base), breakpoint utilities, color palette and design tokens, typography scale system, spacing and sizing utilities, component documentation, and accessibility testing setup. Focus on scalability and maintainability.",
      "reasoning": "Building a comprehensive design system requires careful planning of themes, components, utilities, and responsive behavior. The complexity increases with multiple theme support, accessibility requirements, and the need for a scalable architecture that supports future component additions."

      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Data Layer and TypeScript Interfaces",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Define subtasks for: TypeScript interface definitions (PersonalInfo, Experience, Skills, etc.), Zod schema creation and validation, data service layer implementation, mock data generation, Cloudflare KV integration preparation, error handling and fallback strategies, and data caching mechanisms. Ensure type safety throughout the application.",
      "reasoning": "While conceptually straightforward, this task requires careful type definition to ensure type safety across the application. The integration with Cloudflare KV and implementation of proper validation and error handling adds moderate complexity."

      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Header and Navigation System",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 9,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down into: fixed header component with scroll behavior, smooth scroll navigation implementation, active section detection, mobile menu overlay with gesture support, theme switcher component, keyboard navigation (focus management), accessibility features (ARIA), command palette (âŒ˜K) implementation, and responsive behavior testing. Include performance optimizations for smooth animations.",
      "reasoning": "The header involves complex interactions including scroll behavior, mobile gestures, keyboard navigation, and command palette functionality. The accessibility requirements and smooth animation performance across devices add significant complexity."

      "reasoning": "Cloudflare Workers development requires understanding of edge computing concepts, KV storage patterns, and rate limiting within free tier constraints. The backup mechanism with encryption and API versioning adds significant complexity to ensure data integrity and backward compatibility."
