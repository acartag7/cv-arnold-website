# Release Please - Automated Release Management
#
# This workflow automates semantic versioning and changelog generation.
# It creates a "Release PR" that, when merged, creates a GitHub release.
#
# Workflow:
# 1. Push conventional commits to main (feat:, fix:, chore:, etc.)
# 2. Release Please creates/updates a Release PR with changelog
# 3. Merge the Release PR when ready to release
# 4. GitHub release is created with tag (v1.0.0)
# 5. Tag triggers production deployment workflows
#
# Commit types and their effects:
# - feat: → Minor version bump (1.0.0 → 1.1.0)
# - fix: → Patch version bump (1.0.0 → 1.0.1)
# - feat!: or BREAKING CHANGE: → Major version bump (1.0.0 → 2.0.0)
# - chore:, docs:, style:, refactor:, test: → No version bump
